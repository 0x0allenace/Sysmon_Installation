# üñ•Ô∏è Install Sysmon on Windows 11

## üìå Sysmon Review

**System Monitor** (*Sysmon*) is a Windows system service and device driver that, once installed, stays resident across reboots to monitor and log system activity to the Windows Event Log.  
It provides detailed information about:

- Process creations
- Network connections
- Changes to file creation times

By collecting Sysmon events using [Windows Event Collection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb427443(v=vs.85).aspx) or [SIEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management) tools, you can detect malicious or anomalous activity and understand attacker behavior.  
Sysmon runs as a [protected process](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/protecting-anti-malware-services-#system-protected-process), making it harder for attackers to tamper with.


### üîπ Key Capabilities

- Logs process creation with **full command line** (current & parent process)
- Records hashes of process images (SHA1 default, MD5, SHA256, IMPHASH)
- Supports multiple hash algorithms simultaneously
- Includes **Process GUID** and **Session GUID** for event correlation
- Logs driver/DLL loads with signatures and hashes
- Logs raw disk/volume read access
- Optionally logs **network connections** with process, IP, port, and hostname
- Detects changes in file creation time (anti-tamper detection)
- Auto-reloads config if changed in the registry
- Rule filtering to dynamically include/exclude events
- Captures activity **early in the boot process** to catch kernel-mode malware

‚úÖ If you see Sysmon events being logged, your installation was successful!

If you give me your **screenshot filenames**, I can replace `images/placeholder.png` with their actual paths so when you push to GitHub, everything will be linked and displayed correctly.  

Do you want me to now **replace placeholders with your actual screenshot names**? That way it‚Äôs 100% ready for push.
